1.  Choosing coorrect database will effect our non functional requirements.

2.  For Caching releated things, We can use Redis.

3.  For image, video or files upload, We should use some blob storage like S3.

4.  With S3, We should try to use CDN like AWS Cloudfront for better performance.

5.  For text searching capabilities, We should use elastic search or solr.

6.  Fuzzy search should be enabled, ( Airport ==> Airprot )  EDIT DISTANCE -> 2.

7.  Elastice Search and Solr are not a database, They are search engines.

8.  We should not keep our data as primary source of truth in elastic search and solr.

9.  If we want to build some metrics kind of application, like grafana or prometheus. We should use time series databases.

10. Time series databases --> influxdb, openTSDB etc.

11. If there is usecase of dumping very large data in database and perform some analytic thing and generate a report baseed on that. hadoop will be the best choice.

Secenario Where We will use Relational or Non Relational databases.


1. Structured Data  ====>

   If data is structure and or can be formed in structure easily, Relational databases make more sense.

2. If We decided that our data is structured, Now we can think if We need ACID property or not. (Transactions)

3.  If We need Transactions, Then we can use Relational database like MySQL, Postgres, Oracle.
